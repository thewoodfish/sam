## Samaritan on the web.

Since i'm still getting full grasp of the idea and still "exploring", i've decided to write Samaritan on the web. Seperating mechanism from policy.
Web or Native, C or JS. It doesn't matter. Only the mechanism does. 
So for the web version of samartian, i'll be simulating the cli of minix on the browser. 
Then i'll use the Polkadot-JS client library to connect to the samaritan chain.
And other things would also be simulated, e.g browser localStorage for raw memory, simple JS programs/functions for real native C programs running on an OS.

### After these,
When there's a web MVP, then we can move to Samaritan proper.

### The basic idea remains
A samaritan is a digital state of an individual that is very decentralized and 100% owned and access-controlled by the owner. A samaritan can "possess" 
devices with its state and then programs can access that data, in a well defined infrastructure. 
Ofcourse, there's more story...


Thank you!
