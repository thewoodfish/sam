### Samaritan: A Decentralized Digital Identity Solution

> Just as the word “person” describes a human being, a “Samaritan” describes completely , the digital identity of an individual. A Samaritan can be thought of as a living vessel made up of 1s and 0s  whose personality is created and/or shaped uniquely by an individual's online interactions and data, otherwise known as “state”. 
Samaritans are not new, they exist today in pieces’ scattered across the internet, living rent-free in data silos and storage farms owned by different entities, large and small, with different agendas. All in all, as you know, because the “home” of your state doesn’t belong to you, these “entities” can do whatever they please with your state/data e.g selling them, worse, they can deny you access to your own data! That is quite funny :)

### What is a Samaritan?
A Samaritan is the digital identity of an individual that is able to "possess" devices with its state(static, dynamic and inferred) and maintain controlled access between its state and the outside world.

### What components make up a Samaritan?
A Samaritan stands on three pillars:
- The Samaritan blockchain.
- The Samaritan OS.
- The Samaritan protocol.


### The Samaritan Blockchain
A blockchain simply put, is a distributed immutable ledger. A blockchain is very useful and mandatory for Samaritans in many ways including but not limited to:
- Providing unique unforgeable identity to an individual.
- Uniquely mapping an individual to whatever data(static) she might own.
- Proving and verifying ownership of data.
- Authorizing and revoking access to the online state of the individual.
- Recording online interactions.
- Providing reliable consensus & governance for additions and exclusions from the network.
- Securing the network. 
Etc.

### The Samaritan Operating System
The Samaritan OS is a piece of low-level software that stands as a vessel to be “possessed” at will by any Samaritan. This OS is able to connect with the Samaritan blockchain and other decentralized protocols e.g IPFS. The main function of the OS is to provide the infrastructure for programs running on the OS to interact seamlessly with Samaritans, while ensuring controlled access to the individual’s state. The OS is built to be really light with the Samaritan and its protocols just residing below the user space.

### Where is my data stored?
Samaritans store their state with the help of decentralized storage protocols like IPFS on decentralized storage networks like Crust. All of the data comprising the state are sharded and spread across the globe through a simple incentive model. Nobody can EVER have access or control of your data except when properly authorized. The Samaritan OS is able to gather this state at will and present it to the user on any devices the user may choose to use. Your state is independent of any device. It is everywhere and nowhere!

### What about the programs I choose to run?
Programs follow some procedures before they can be run on a Samaritan OS. In a high abstraction for a typical program:
- The program must be verified by the network validators in a purely decentralized manner.
- If the program passes, it is committed to decentralized storage networks and is added to the ability pool.
- The program is then discoverable by every Samaritan across the globe.
- It can be then added to a users state by download.
- On running the program, the Samaritan checks to see what data the program might need to run properly. 
- Granting, revoking, logging of data data, behavior and access is controlled by the individual through the Samaritan protocol.

### The Samaritan Protocol
This describes the rules, SDKs, semantics of synchronization between the actors comprising the Samaritan exosystem.

### Technologies to be utilized in bringing an MVP to life?
The following technologies including but not limited to the below are to be employed for its development:
- Minix OS: This is the OS that will be modified for the creation of an MVP.
- Substrate: A next-gen blockchain framework.
- A Substrate Client written in C.
- The C language.
Etc.


### Progress?
Samaritan is still in its early stage undergoing its idealization testing phase. It is currently being lightly built with its client as a simulated terminal on a browser. This encourages quick-testing and speed of changing ideas and implementation paths. It is currently utilizes JavaScript, node-js and Substrate.
